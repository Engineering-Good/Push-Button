How to use the buttons
**********************

You should have received a student's button and a teacher's button which are
already paired to each other and ready to use. If you want to use a combination
of buttons which were not previously used with each other, see
:ref:`section-pairing`.

#. Connect the toy to the student's button.
#. Turn both buttons on by setting the main switch to the 'on' position (I).
#. The status LEDs will blink while the buttons are connecting to each other.
   This often takes 15-30 seconds.
#. After the status LEDs on both buttons stop blinking, they are ready to use.

Status LED
**********

The following table provides an overview of the various LED blinking patterns.

+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| LED pattern                   | Button status                          |
+===============================+========================================+
| Blinking 2-3 times per second | Reference voltage measurement mode     |
|                               | (see :ref:`section-reference-voltage`) |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Blinking once per second      | Button is not connected                |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Blinking every two seconds    | Battery empty                          |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Steady light                  | Button connected and ready to use      |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

Charging the buttons
********************

The push buttons contain a built-in USB charger. You can use any regular phone
or tablet charger.

To recharge the buttons, flip the main switch to the charging position (II).
Plug in a USB charger. There's a small hole in the bottom of the push button,
below the charger, through which you can see the charging light:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Light colour | Charging status                                            |
+==============+============================================================+
| Red          | Charging                                                   |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Green        | Fully charged or main switch not in charging position (II) |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

When the button is fully charged, unplug the USB charger and set the main
switch back to 'off' (O). If the main switch is left in the charging position
(II) for a very long time, the batteries will self-discharge and potentially
damage.

Replacing the batteries
***********************

It is normally not necessary to replace the included rechargeable batteries.

.. danger::
   Only use rechargeable Lithium Iron Phophate (LiFePo4) batteries. Do not
   attempt to use regular batteries. When exchanging the batteries, be sure to
   insert them as marked in the battery compartment. Inserting batteries of the
   wrong type or in the wrong orientation may result in damage to the buttons
   and/or a fire hazard! If unsure, do not hesitate to ask for help!

The push buttons use LiFePo4 batteries with a nominal voltage of 3.2V. The
correct orientation of the batteries is **hand-labeled** inside the battery
compartment and may deviate from the orientation marked in the plastic or the
orientation suggested by the battery holder. Both batteries must have the same
orientation. They are to be connected in parallel, not in series. 

.. _section-configuration:

Configuring the buttons
***********************

The `EGPushButton Configurator`_ app can connect to any student's button or
teacher's button (in configuration mode) to inspect and change its settings.

To be able to connect to a student's button, it must not be connected to any
other device already. Specifically, switch off its associated teacher's button
while configuring the student's button.

To put a teacher's button into configuration mode, hold down its push button
while switching the button on.

A student's button provides the following options:

* :guilabel:`Button number` between 1 and 99 (used for pairing, see :ref:`section-pairing`)
* :guilabel:`Button mode` ('Student', can be set to 'Teacher')
* :guilabel:`Enabled` status (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
* :guilabel:`Min. pushes` and :guilabel:`Max. pushes` (1-255) between which the
  button is randomly disabled
* Toy :guilabel:`Operation time` per push in seconds (1-255)
* :guilabel:`Reference voltage` in millivolts (to be set during manufacturing, see
  :ref:`section-reference-voltage`)
  
It also displays the following information:

* Current number of button pushes and current random limit after which the
  button will be disabled
* Current :guilabel:`Toy status` (off or on)
* :guilabel:`Firmware version`

The teacher's button only offers the following options:

* :guilabel:`Button number` between 1 and 99
* :guilabel:`Button mode` ('Teacher', can be set to 'Student')
* :guilabel:`Reference voltage`
* :guilabel:`Firmware version` for information

Numeric settings can be saved to the button by pressing the |app-save-button|
icon next to it. To refresh a value or status, press the |app-refresh-button|
icon next to it.

For the button number or mode settings to take effect, you need to restart the
button.

.. _section-pairing:

Pairing student and teacher buttons
***********************************

Each button (student and teacher) has a button number. A teacher button will
try to connect to a student button with the same number as its own. To pair a
teacher button to a different student button, you will have to change the
button number of one or both of them. It does not matter which number between
1 and 99 you choose, but it should be different from other button pairs you may
be using.

To change a button's number you need to use the `EGPushButton Configurator`_
app.

To change the number of a student's button
==========================================

#. Make sure any teacher's buttons in the vicinity are off, otherwise they
   interfere with the app connection.
#. Turn the student's button on.
#. Find the student's button in the app and connect to it.
#. Enter the new button number into the app and press the |app-save-button| icon next to it.
#. Turn the student's button off and on again for the change to take effect.

To change the number of a teacher's button
==========================================

#. Hold down the teacher's push button while turning it on.
#. Find the teacher's button in the app and connect to it.
#. Enter the new button number into the app and press the |app-save-button| icon next to it.
#. Turn the teacher's button off and on again for the change to take effect.
