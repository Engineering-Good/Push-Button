Introduction
############

The aim of the EG PushButton project is to encourage autistic students to ask
their teacher for help when playing with electric toys.

The EG PushButton project consists of two hardware devices:

* Student's button: A remotely resettable toy activation button
* Teacher's button: A button to remotely reset the student's button

There's also a companion project providing an Android app to configure the push
buttons: `EGPushButton Configurator`_

The student's button is an easy-to-operate accessibility push button to
activate an electric toy. When the student's button is pushed, a relay is
closed, powering the connected toy.

In order to encourage autistic students to ask their teacher for help, the
student's button disables itself after a random number of pushes. When the
student asks for help, the teacher can then re-enable the student's button by
pushing the teacher's button.

The two buttons communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). An Android app is
available to configure the push buttons.

This project was developed for `Engineering Good`_.
